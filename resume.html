      I was in many orchestral groups at Lancaster Central High.
      I was in the Symphony Orchestra for three years which is the most advanced orchestra at Lancaster,
      to get in, you must audition in front of the director, Mrs. Ruda.
      I was the principal cellist in this orchestra for two years.
      I also was in the String Orchestra, which is a non-audition orchestra. I was in it my freshman, junior, and senior years.
      I was the principal cellist in this orchestra for two years and was an officer my senior year.
      I also was in Swingin' Strings, a non-classical group that meets weekly and performs gigs all over western New York.
      Lastly, I have been in the High School's productions of Beauty and the Beast and The Adams Family.
      I also attended the Lancaster High School Academy of Visual and Performing Arts or AVPA.
      Through this, I performed two public solo performances of Bach's Suite No.1 Prelude and Vivaldi's Sonata No. 6 Mvt. 1 + 2.
      For my final solo in high school, I performed Bach's Toccata in D minor from memory in my senior year.
      I excelled in college-prep curricula, including AP Music Theory and Leadership in Music.

      I played on the JV volleyball team for two years and was a starting middle for the latter year.
      I also made it onto the Varsity volleyball team for my Junior year and was the starting middle in my Senior year.
      Following the conclusion of the school volleyball season in my sophomore year, I joined the Lockport Volleyball Club.
      Through this, I greatly improved my strength and skill. I also got to travel across the US and participate in International competitions.
      My greatest achievement during the club season would probably be winning gold at the East Coast Championship in Virginia.
      In school, I have been awarded "NYSPHSAA Scholar Athlete" twice, "Most blocks per set in varsity volleyball" twice,
      "NYSPHSAA Section VI Finalist in varsity volleyball" and "Volleyball ECIC Division 1 All-Star 2nd Team" in my senior year.
      I played on the intramural volleyball team RITSEC, starting my second year at RIT.
